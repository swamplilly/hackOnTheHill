"How about a trip to _category name_ ? For _dollahs_?"

From 2012: 

Price range is the APPROXIMATE
cost per person for a meal incl. one
drink, tax and tip.

$= under $10
$$= $11-$30
$$$= $31-$60
$$$$= above $61

So..scale slightly to adjust for inflation, then take geometric mean of each.

Uber tests in uber test file, yelp tests in yelp test file.
